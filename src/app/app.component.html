    <h3>What is Open Chennai?</h3>
    <div>Open Chennai is a collective effort by the citizens of Chennai to make our city better. We report and keep
      track of civic issues within the city.
    </div>

    <h3>What do we gain by reporting and tracking issues? Is any action guaranteed to fix the reported issues?</h3>
    <div>Our initial aim is to bring concerns of the citizens into the limelight and never lose track of them. When we
      report and track issues together, we reach a larger audience.
      The sum of our efforts becomes larger than its parts. This would be equivalent to something like Wikipedia, but
      for the city's civic issues. We hope to get involved in taking action as well, but no promises for now.

      We even have a leaderboard for you, if you are into such things!
    </div>

    <h3>Where do I view already reported issues?</h3>
    <div>
      <div>We are currently using GitHub to track issues. Follow the links to find issues under different sections.

      <h4>The easy way</h4>
      <div>Report issues to us on
        <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://twitter.com/openchennai">Twitter</a>,
        <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.facebook.com/openchennai/">Facebook</a>
        or on

      </div>
      <h4>The better way</h4>
      <div>
        Raise GitHub issues on the respective repositories. If you are not familiar with raising GitHub
        issues,
        <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://help.github.com/articles/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account">create
          a GitHub account</a>
        and find out how to create issues
        <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue">here</a>.
      </div>
    </div>


    <h3>Are there general guidelines for reporting an issue?</h3>
    <div>
      Use the following template at the beginning when creating a new issue:
      <ul>
        <li>Reporter: <i>name of reporter</i></li>
        <li>Link: <i>link to their social account</i></li>
      </ul>
      Please be as detailed as you can and add photos, links to the geographical location of the issue, if possible.
    </div>

    <h3>Who is running this effort? What are your motivations?</h3>
    <div>We are just a group of individuals coming together to solve our own problems. We have no affiliations to any
      political entity and our intention is to build a community of like-minded citizens to solve our city's problems.
