    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    <h3>What is Open Chennai?</h3>
    <div>Open Chennai is a collective effort by the citizens of Chennai to make our city better. We report and keep
      track
      of
      civic issues within the city.
    </div>

    <h3>What do we gain by reporting and tracking issues? Is any action guaranteed to fix the reported issues?</h3>
    <div>Our initial aim is to bring concerns of the citizens into the limelight and never lose track of them. When we
      report and track issues together, we reach a larger audience.
      The sum of our efforts becomes larger than its parts. This would be equivalent to something like Wikipedia, but
      for
      the city's civic issues. We hope to get involved in taking action as well, but no promises for now.
    </div>

    <h3>Where do I view already reported issues?</h3>
